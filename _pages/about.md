I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [eMedia Research Lab](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/emedia), ESAT-STADIUS, KU Leuven. I received my PhD in September 2024 from ESAT, KU Leuven, in collaboration with the Life Science Department at [IMEC](https://www.imec-int.com/en). Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

My research interests include AI for Health (AI4Health), Sensor Fusion, Time Series Data Processing, and FMCW Radar.
